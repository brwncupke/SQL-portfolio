# HR database design 

In this project I have created and design HR sql database for the small business. 
The HR sample database has seven tables:

1. The **employees** table stores the data of employees.
2. The **jobs** table stores the job data including job title and salary range.
3. The **departments** table stores department data.
4. The **dependents** table stores the employeeâ€™s dependents.
5. The **locations** table stores the location of the departments of the company.
6. The **countries** table stores the data of countries where the company is doing business.
7. The **regions** table stores the data of regions such as Asia, Europe, America, and the Middle East and Africa. The countries are grouped into regions.
